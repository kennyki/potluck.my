export default `<p>Potluck.my is an app that lets you organize a potluck party easily. Instead of doing a long chain of group chat messages, send a link to everyone and work out who's doing/bringing what. All in real time!</p>

<p>With this app, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify yourself with a name which creates a profile in your current browser session.</li>
<li>Create an upcoming event with a name.</li>
<li>Add a notice visible to everyone with access to the event, for example, "Everybody brings something" or "We need mains, drinks, and desserts".</li>
<li>Share the event's link to people you want to invite.</li>
<li>Copy the event's content to share (formatted for WhatsApp or HTML).</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to enable a fussless experience for everyone involved in a potluck party preparation, so you can focus on readying the best things in real life.</p>

<p>This app tries to collect as little personal information as possible (names only) to be usable. It was built as a personal side project and for the <a href='https://cloud.appwrite.io/hackathon' target='_blank'>Appwrite Cloud Hackathon</a>. It is open-source, and you can find the source code at <a href='https://github.com/kennyki/potluck.my' target='_blank'>Github</a>.</p>
